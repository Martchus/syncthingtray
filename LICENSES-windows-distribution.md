> 
>   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
> software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
> General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
> Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
> using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
> the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
> if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
> in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
> These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
> you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
> source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
> rights.
> 
>   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
>   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
>   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
> patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
> program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
> program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
> patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.

>                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
>   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
> a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
> under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
> refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
> means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
> that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
> either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
> language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
> the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
> running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
> is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
> Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
> Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
>   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
> source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
> conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
> copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
> notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
> and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
> along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
>   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
> of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
> distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
> above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
>     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
>     parties under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
>     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
>     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
>     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
>     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
>     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
>     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
> and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
> on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
> this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
> a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
> the scope of this License.
> 
>   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
>     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
>     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
>     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
>     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
>     received the program in object code or executable form with such
>     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
> code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
> control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
> special exception, the source code distributed need not include
> anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
> form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
> operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
> itself accompanies the executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
> access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
> access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
> distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
> compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
> 
>   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
> void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
> However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
> this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
> parties remain in full compliance.
> 
>   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
> all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
> the Program or works based on it.
> 
>   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
> restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
> You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
> this License.
> 
>   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
> may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
> license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
> the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
> refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
> implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
> generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
> through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
> to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
> impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
> be a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
>   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
> may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
> those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
> countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
> the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
>   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
> of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
> either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
> Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
> this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
> Foundation.
> 
>   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
> to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
> Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
> make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
> of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
> of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
>                             NO WARRANTY
> 
>   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
> FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
> OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
> PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

> TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
> PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
> REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
> REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
> OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
> TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
> YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
> PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
> POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
>                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

>             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
>   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
>   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
> to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
> convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
> the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,

> with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
> it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
>   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the

> permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
> 
>   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that

> 
>   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
> any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
> effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
> restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
> any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
> consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
> 
>   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
> ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
> is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
> this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
> libraries into non-free programs.
> 
>   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
> a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
> combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
> General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
> entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
> Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
> the library.
> 
>   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
> does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
> Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
> of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
> are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
> libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
> special circumstances.
> 
>   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
> encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
> a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
> allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
> library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
> case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
> software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
> 
>   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
> programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
> free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
> non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
> operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
> system.
> 
>   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
> users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
> linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
> that program using a modified version of the Library.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a

>   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the

> Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
> 
>   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
> that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
> derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
> Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be

> threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
> 
>   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data

> functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
> file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
> work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
> Library will still fall under Section 6.)
> 
>   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
> distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
> Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
> whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
> 
>   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
> link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
> work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
> under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
> modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
> engineering for debugging such modifications.
> 
>   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
> Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
> this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
> during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
> copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
> directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
> of these things:
> 
>     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
>     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
>     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
>     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
>     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
>     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
>     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
>     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>     to use the modified definitions.)
> 
>     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
>     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
>     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
>     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
>     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
>     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
>     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
> 
>     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>     least three years, to give the same user the materials
>     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>     than the cost of performing this distribution.
> 
>     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
>     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
>     specified materials from the same place.
> 
>     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
>     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
> 
>   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the

> 
>   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license

>   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
> Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library

>     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
>     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
>     Sections above.
> 
>     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact

>   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

> 
>   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the

> 
> The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
> functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
> assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
> with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
> Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
> to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
> for modifications made by others.
> 
> This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
> works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
> complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
> license designed for free software.
> 
> We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
> software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
> program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
> software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
> it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
> whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
> principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
> 
> 
> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
> 
> This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
> contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
> distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
> world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
> work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
> refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
> licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
> copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
> under copyright law.
> 
> A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
> Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
> modifications and/or translated into another language.
> 
> A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
> the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
> publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
> (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
> within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
> textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
> mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
> connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
> commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
> them.
> 
> The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
> are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
> that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
> section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
> allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
> Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
> Sections then there are none.
> 
> The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
> as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
> the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
> be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
> 
> A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
> represented in a format whose specification is available to the
> general public, that is suitable for revising the document
> straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
> pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
> drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
> for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
> to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
> format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
> or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
> An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
> of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
> 
> Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
> ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
> or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
> HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
> transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
> include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
> proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
> processing tools are not generally available, and the
> machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
> processors for output purposes only.
> 
> The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
> plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
> this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
> formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
> the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
> preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
> 
> A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
> title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
> text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
> specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
> "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
> of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
> section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
> 
> The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
> states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
> Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
> License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other

> 
> 2. VERBATIM COPYING
> 
> You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
> commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
> copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
> to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
> conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
> technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
> copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
> compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
> number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
> 
> You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
> you may publicly display copies.
> 
> 
> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
> 
> If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
> printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
> Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
> copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
> Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
> the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
> you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
> the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
> visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
> Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
> the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
> as verbatim copying in other respects.
> 
> If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
> legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
> reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
> pages.
> 
> If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
> more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
> copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
> a computer-network location from which the general network-using
> public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
> a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
> If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
> when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
> that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
> location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
> Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
> edition to the public.
> 
> It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
> Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
> them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
> 
> 
> 4. MODIFICATIONS
> 
> You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
> the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
> the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
> Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
> and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
> of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
> 
> A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
>    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
>    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
>    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
>    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
> B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
>    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
>    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
>    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
>    unless they release you from this requirement.
> C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
>    Modified Version, as the publisher.
> D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
> E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
>    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
> F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
>    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
>    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
> G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
>    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
> H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
> I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
>    to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
>    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
>    there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
>    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
>    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
>    Version as stated in the previous sentence.
> J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
>    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
>    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
>    it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
>    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
>    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
>    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
> K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
>    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
>    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
>    and/or dedications given therein.
> L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
>    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
>    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
> M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
>    may not be included in the Modified Version.
> N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
>    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
> O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
> 
> If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
> appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
> copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
> of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
> list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
> These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
> 
> You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
> nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
> parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
> been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
> standard.
> 
> You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
> passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
> of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
> Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
> through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
> includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
> by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
> you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
> permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
> 
> The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
> give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
> imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
> 
> 
> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
> 
> You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
> License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
> versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
> Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
> list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
> license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
> 
> The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
> multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
> copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
> different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
> adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
> author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
> Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
> Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
> 
> In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
> in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
> "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
> and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
> Entitled "Endorsements".
> 
> 
> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
> 
> You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
> released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
> License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
> the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
> verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
> 
> You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
> it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
> License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
> other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
> 
> 
> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
> 
> A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
> and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
> distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
> resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
> of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
> When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
> apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
> derivative works of the Document.
> 
> If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
> copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
> the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
> covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
> electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
> Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
> aggregate.
> 
> 
> 8. TRANSLATION
> 
> Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
> distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
> Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
> permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
> translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
> original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
> translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
> Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
> the original English version of this License and the original versions
> of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
> the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
> or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
> 
> If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
> "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
> its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
> title.
> 
> 
> 9. TERMINATION
> 
> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
> as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
> copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
> parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
> License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
> parties remain in full compliance.
> 
> 
> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
> 
> The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
> of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
> 
> Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
> If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
> License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
> following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
> of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
> Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
> as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 
> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
> 
> To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
> the License in the document and put the following copyright and
> license notices just after the title page:
> 
>     Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
>     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
>     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
>     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
>     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
>     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
>     Free Documentation License".
> 
> If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
> replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
> 
>     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
>     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
> 
> If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
> combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
> situation.
> 
> If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
> recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
> free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
> to permit their use in free software.

> 
> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
> license document, but changing it is not allowed.
> 
> This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
> permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
> 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
> bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
> the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
> 
> When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
> certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
> program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
> non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
> header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
> 
> 0. Definitions.
> 
> A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
> Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
> interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
> on the Runtime Library.
> 
> "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
> modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
> the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
> subsequent versions published by the FSF.
> 
> "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
> modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
> the license of GCC.
> 
> "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
> target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
> input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
> phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
> format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
> for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
> 
> The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
> non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
> Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
> use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
> part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
> understood as starting with the output of the generators or
> preprocessors.
> 
> A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
> with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
> work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
> optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
> Eligible Compilation Process.
> 
> 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
> 
> You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
> combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
> propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
> all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
> may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
> consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
> 
> 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
> 
> The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
> presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
> requirements of the license of GCC.

> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
> 
>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
> 
>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to

> 
>   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
> free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
> 
>   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
> specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
> Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
> can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
> this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
> strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
> not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
> you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
> for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
> it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
> it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
> these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
> rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
> you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
> you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
> code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
> complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
> with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
> it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
>   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
> library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
> permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
> 
>   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
> there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
> modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
> that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
> author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
> introduced by others.
> 
>   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
> any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
> effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
> restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
> any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
> consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
> 
>   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
> ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
> is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
> this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
> libraries into non-free programs.
> 
>   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
> a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
> combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
> General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
> entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
> Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
> the library.
> 
>   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
> does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
> Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
> of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
> are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
> libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
> special circumstances.
> 
>   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
> encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
> a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
> allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
> library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
> case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
> software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
> 
>   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
> programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
> free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
> non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
> operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
> system.
> 
>   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
> users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
> linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
> that program using a modified version of the Library.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
> "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
> former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must

> 
>   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
> prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
> (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
> 
>   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
> which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
> Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
> copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
> portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
> straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
> included without limitation in the term "modification".)
> 
>   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

> interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
> and installation of the library.
> 
>   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
> running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
> such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
> on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
> writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
> and what the program that uses the Library does.
> 
>   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
> complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
> you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an

> 
>   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,

>   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion

> 
>     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
>     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
> 
>     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
>     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses

> 
>   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
> Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
> linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
> work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
> therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
> 
>   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
> creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
> contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
> library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
> Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
> 
>   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
> that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
> derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
> Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be

> threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
> 
>   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
> structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
> functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
> file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
> work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
> Library will still fall under Section 6.)
> 
>   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
> distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
> Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
> whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
> 
>   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or

> 
>   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
> Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by

> 
>     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding

>     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked

>     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>     to use the modified definitions.)
> 
>     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
>     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
>     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
>     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
>     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
>     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
>     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
> 
>     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>     least three years, to give the same user the materials
>     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>     than the cost of performing this distribution.
> 
>     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy

>

>   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the

>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
>  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
> 
>                             Preamble
> 
>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
> software and other kinds of works.
> 
>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
> or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
> know their rights.
> 
>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
> 
>   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
> authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
> authors of previous versions.
> 
>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
> protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
> products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
> of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
> 
>   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
> software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
> avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
> make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
> patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.

>                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
>   0. Definitions.
> 
>   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 
>   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
> works, such as semiconductor masks.
> 
>   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
> License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
> "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
> 
>   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
> exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
> earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
> 
>   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
> on the Program.
> 
>   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
> permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
> infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
> computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
> distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
> public, and in some countries other activities as well.
> 
>   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
> parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
> a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
> 
>   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
> feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
> tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
> extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
> work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
> the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
> menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
> 
>   1. Source Code.
> 
>   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
> form of a work.
> 
>   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
> standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
> interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
> is widely used among developers working in that language.
> 
>   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
> than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
> packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
> Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
> Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
> implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
> "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
> (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
> control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
> System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
> programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
> which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
> includes interface definition files associated with source files for
> the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
> linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
> such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
> subprograms and other parts of the work.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
> can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
> Source.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that

> 
>   2. Basic Permissions.
> 
>   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
> copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
> conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
> permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
> covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
> content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
> rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 
>   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
> convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
> in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
> of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
> with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
> the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
> not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
> for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
> and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
> your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 
>   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
> the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
> makes it unnecessary.
> 
>   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
> 
>   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
> measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
> 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
> similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
> measures.
> 
>   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
> circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
> is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
> the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
> modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
> users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
> technological measures.
> 
>   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 
>   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
> receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
> keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
> non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
> keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
> recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
> and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 
>   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 
>   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
>     it, and giving a relevant date.
> 
>     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
>     released under this License and any conditions added under section
>     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
> 
>     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
>     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
>     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
>     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
>     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
>     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
>     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> 
>     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
>     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
>     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
>     work need not make them do so.
> 
>   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
> works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
> and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
> in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
> "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
> used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
> beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
> parts of the aggregate.
> 
>   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
> of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
> machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
> in one of these ways:
> 
>     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
>     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
>     customarily used for software interchange.
> 
>     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
>     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
>     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
>     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
>     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
>     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
>     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
>     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
>     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
>     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> 
>     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
>     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
>     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
>     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
>     with subsection 6b.
> 
>     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
>     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
>     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
>     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
>     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
>     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
>     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
>     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> 
>     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
>     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
>     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
>     charge under subsection 6d.
> 
>   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
> from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
> included in conveying the object code work.
> 
>   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
> into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
> doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
> product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
> typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
> of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
> actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
> is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
> commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
> the only significant mode of use of the product.
> 
>   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
> procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
> and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
> a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
> suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
> code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
> modification has been made.
> 
>   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
> specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
> part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
> User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
> fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
> Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
> by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
> if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
> modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
> been installed in ROM).
> 
>   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
> requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
> for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
> the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
> network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
> adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
> protocols for communication across the network.
> 
>   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
> in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
> documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
> source code form), and must require no special password or key for
> unpacking, reading or copying.
> 
>   7. Additional Terms.
> 
>   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
> License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
> Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
> be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
> that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
> apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
> under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
> this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> 
>   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
> remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
> it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
> removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
> additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
> for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 
>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> 
>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> 
>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> 
>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
>     authors of the material; or
> 
>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> 
>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
>     those licensors and authors.
> 
>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
> restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
> received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
> governed by this License along with a term that is a further
> restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
> a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
> License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
> of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
> not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 
>   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
> must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
> additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
> where to find the applicable terms.
> 
>   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
> form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
> the above requirements apply either way.
> 
>   8. Termination.
> 
>   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
> provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
> modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
> this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
> paragraph of section 11).
> 
>   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
> license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
> finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
> holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
> prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 
>   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
>   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
> material under section 10.
> 
>   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 
>   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
> run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
> to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
> nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
> modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
> not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
> covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 
>   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 
>   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
> receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
> propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 
>   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
> organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
> organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
> work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
> transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
> licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
> give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
> Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
> the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> 
>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
> rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
> not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
> rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
> any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
> sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 
>   11. Patents.
> 
>   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
> License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
> work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> 
>   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
> owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
> hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
> by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
> but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
> consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
> purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
> patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
> this License.
> 
>   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
> make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
> propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 
>   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
> sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
> party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
> patent against the party.
> 
>   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
> and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
> to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
> publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
> then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
> available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
> patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
> consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
> license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
> actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
> covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
> country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 
>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
> work and works based on it.
> 
>   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
> specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
> work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
> in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
> to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
> the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
> parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
> patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
> conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
> for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
> contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
> or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 
>   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
> any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
> otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 
>   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 
>   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
> covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
> not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
> to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
> the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
> License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 
>   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
> permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
> under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
> combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
> License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
> but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
> section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
> combination as such.
> 
>   14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
> the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
> Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
> Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
> option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
> version or of any later version published by the Free Software
> Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
> GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
> by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
> versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
> public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
> to choose that version for the Program.
> 
>   Later license versions may give you additional or different
> permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
> author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
> later version.
> 
>   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
> 
>   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
> APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
> HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
> OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
> THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
> PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
> IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
> ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   16. Limitation of Liability.
> 
>   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
> THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
> GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
> USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
> DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
> PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
> EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
> SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
>   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
> 
>   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
> above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
> reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
> an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
> Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
> copy of the Program in return for a fee.
> 
>                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
>             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
>   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
>   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
> to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
> state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
> the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

>      <http://fsf.org/>
>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
>  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
> 
> 0. PREAMBLE
> 
> The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
> functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
> assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
> with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
> Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
> to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
> for modifications made by others.
> 
> This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
> works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
> complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
> license designed for free software.
> 
> We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
> software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
> program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
> software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
> it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
> whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
> principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
> 
> 
> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
> 
> This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
> contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
> distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
> world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
> work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
> refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
> licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
> copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
> under copyright law.
> 
> A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
> Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
> modifications and/or translated into another language.
> 
> A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
> the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
> publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
> subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
> directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
> part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
> any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
> connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
> commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
> them.
> 
> The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
> are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
> that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
> section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
> allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
> Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
> Sections then there are none.
> 
> The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
> as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
> the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
> be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
> 
> A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
> represented in a format whose specification is available to the
> general public, that is suitable for revising the document
> straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
> pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
> drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
> for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
> to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
> format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
> or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
> An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
> of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
> 
> Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
> ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
> or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
> HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
> transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
> include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
> proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
> processing tools are not generally available, and the
> machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
> processors for output purposes only.
> 
> The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
> plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
> this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
> formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
> the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
> preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
> 
> The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
> the Document to the public.
> 
> A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
> title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
> text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
> specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
> "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
> of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
> section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
> 
> The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
> states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
> Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
> License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
> implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
> no effect on the meaning of this License.
> 
> 2. VERBATIM COPYING
> 
> You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
> commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
> copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
> to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
> other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
> technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
> copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
> compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
> number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
> 
> You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
> you may publicly display copies.
> 
> 
> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
> 
> If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
> printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
> Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
> copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
> Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
> the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
> you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
> the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
> visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
> Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
> the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
> as verbatim copying in other respects.
> 
> If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
> legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
> reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
> pages.
> 
> If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
> more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
> copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
> a computer-network location from which the general network-using
> public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
> a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
> If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
> when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
> that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
> location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
> Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
> edition to the public.
> 
> It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
> Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
> give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
> Document.
> 
> 
> 4. MODIFICATIONS
> 
> You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
> the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
> the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
> Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
> and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
> of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
> 
> A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
>    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
>    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
>    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
>    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
> B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
>    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
>    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
>    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
>    unless they release you from this requirement.
> C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
>    Modified Version, as the publisher.
> D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
> E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
>    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
> F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
>    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
>    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
> G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
>    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
> H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
> I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
>    to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
>    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
>    there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
>    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
>    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
>    Version as stated in the previous sentence.
> J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
>    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
>    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
>    it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
>    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
>    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
>    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
> K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
>    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
>    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
>    and/or dedications given therein.
> L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
>    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
>    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
> M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
>    may not be included in the Modified Version.
> N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
>    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
> O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
> 
> If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
> appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
> copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
> of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
> list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
> These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
> 
> You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
> nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
> parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
> been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
> standard.
> 
> You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
> passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
> of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
> Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
> through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
> includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
> by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
> you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
> permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
> 
> The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
> give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
> imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
> 
> 
> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
> 
> You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
> License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
> versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
> Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
> list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
> license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
> 
> The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
> multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
> copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
> different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
> adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
> author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
> Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
> Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
> 
> In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
> in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
> "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
> and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
> Entitled "Endorsements".
> 
> 
> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
> 
> You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
> documents released under this License, and replace the individual
> copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
> that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
> of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
> other respects.
> 
> You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
> distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
> copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
> License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
> document.
> 
> 
> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
> 
> A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
> and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
> distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
> resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
> of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
> When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
> apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
> derivative works of the Document.
> 
> If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
> copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
> the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
> covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
> electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
> Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
> aggregate.
> 
> 
> 8. TRANSLATION
> 
> Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
> distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
> Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
> permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
> translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
> original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
> translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
> Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
> the original English version of this License and the original versions
> of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
> the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
> or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
> 
> If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
> "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
> its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
> title.
> 
> 
> 9. TERMINATION
> 
> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
> except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
> will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
> 
> However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
> from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
> unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
> terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
> fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
> 60 days after the cessation.
> 
> Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
> Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
> not give you any rights to use it.
> 
> 
> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
> 
> The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
> GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
> will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
> detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
> http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
> 
> Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
> If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
> License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
> following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
> of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
> Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
> as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
> specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
> License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
> version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
> Document.
> 
> 11. RELICENSING
> 
> "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
> World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
> provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
> public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
> "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
> means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
> 
> "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
> license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
> corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
> California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
> published by that same organization.
> 
> "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in

> 
> An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
> License, and if all works that were first published under this License

> 
>   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
> software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
> General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
> Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
> using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
> the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
> if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
> in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
> These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
> you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
> source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
> rights.
> 
>   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
>   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
>   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
> patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
> program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
> program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
> patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
>                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
>   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
> a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
> under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
> refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
> means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
> that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
> either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
> language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
> the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
> running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
> is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
> Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
> Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
>   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
> source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
> conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
> copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
> notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
> and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
> along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
>   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
> of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
> distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
> above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
>     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
>     parties under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
>     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
>     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
>     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
>     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
>     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
>     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
> and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
> on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
> this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
> a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
> the scope of this License.
> 
>   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
>     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
>     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
>     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
>     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
>     received the program in object code or executable form with such
>     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
> code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
> control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
> special exception, the source code distributed need not include
> anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
> form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
> operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
> itself accompanies the executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
> access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
> access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
> distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
> compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
> 
>   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
> void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
> However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
> this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
> parties remain in full compliance.
> 
>   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
> all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
> the Program or works based on it.
> 
>   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
> restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
> You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
> this License.
> 
>   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
> may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
> license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
> the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
> refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
> implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
> generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
> through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
> to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
> impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
> be a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
>   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
> may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
> those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
> countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
> the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
>   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
> of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
> either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
> Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
> this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
> Foundation.
> 
>   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
> to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
> Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
> make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
> of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
> of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
>                             NO WARRANTY
> 
>   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
> FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
> OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
> PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
> OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
> MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
> TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
> PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
> REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
> REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
> OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

> 
>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for

> 
>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive

> 
>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
> 
>   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
> authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
> authors of previous versions.
> 
>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
> protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
> products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions

> 
>   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
> software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to

>   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 
>   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of

> 
>   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an

> 
>   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based

> 
>   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without

> 
>   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other

>   1. Source Code.
> 
>   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
> form of a work.
> 
>   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official

>

> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

>   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
> control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
> System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free

> 
>   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
> copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
> conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
> permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
> covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
> content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
> rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 
>   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
> convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
> in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
> of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
> with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
> the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
> not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
> for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
> and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
> your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 
>   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under

> 
>   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
> circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
> is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to

> 
>   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 
>   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
> receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
> keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
> non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
> keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
> recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
> and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 
>   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 
>   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
>     it, and giving a relevant date.
> 
>     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
>     released under this License and any conditions added under section
>     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
> 
>     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
>     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
>     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
>     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
>     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
>     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
>     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> 
>     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
>     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
>     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
>     work need not make them do so.
> 
>   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
> works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
> and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
> in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
> "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
> used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
> beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
> parts of the aggregate.
> 
>   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
> of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
> machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
> in one of these ways:
> 
>     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
>     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
>     customarily used for software interchange.
> 
>     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
>     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
>     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
>     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
>     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
>     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
>     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
>     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
>     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
>     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> 
>     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
>     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
>     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
>     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
>     with subsection 6b.
> 
>     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
>     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
>     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
>     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
>     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
>     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
>     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
>     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> 
>     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
>     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
>     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
>     charge under subsection 6d.
> 
>   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
> from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
> included in conveying the object code work.
> 
>   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
> into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
> doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
> product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
> typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
> of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
> actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
> is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
> commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
> the only significant mode of use of the product.
> 
>   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
> procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
> and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
> a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
> suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
> code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
> modification has been made.
> 
>   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
> specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
> part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
> User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
> fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
> Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
> by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
> if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
> modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
> been installed in ROM).
> 
>   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
> requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
> for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
> the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
> network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
> adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
> protocols for communication across the network.
> 
>   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
> in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
> documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
> source code form), and must require no special password or key for
> unpacking, reading or copying.
> 
>   7. Additional Terms.
> 
>   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
> License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
> Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
> be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
> that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
> apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
> under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
> this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> 
>   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
> remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
> it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
> removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
> additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
> for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 
>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> 
>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> 
>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> 
>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
>     authors of the material; or
> 
>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> 
>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
>     those licensors and authors.
> 
>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
> restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
> received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
> governed by this License along with a term that is a further
> restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
> a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
> License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
> of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
> not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 
>   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
> must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
> additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
> where to find the applicable terms.
> 
>   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
> form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
> the above requirements apply either way.
> 
>   8. Termination.
> 
>   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
> provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
> modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
> this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
> paragraph of section 11).
> 
>   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
> license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
> finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
> holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
> prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 
>   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
>   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
> material under section 10.
> 
>   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 
>   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
> run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
> to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
> nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
> modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
> not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
> covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 
>   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 
>   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
> receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
> propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 
>   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
> organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
> organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
> work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
> transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
> licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
> give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
> Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
> the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> 
>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
> rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
> not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
> rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
> any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
> sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 
>   11. Patents.
> 
>   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
> License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
> work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> 
>   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
> owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
> hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
> by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
> but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
> consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
> purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
> patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
> this License.
> 
>   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
> make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
> propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 
>   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
> sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
> party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
> patent against the party.
> 
>   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
> and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
> to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
> publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
> then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
> available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
> patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
> consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
> license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
> actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
> covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
> country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 
>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
> work and works based on it.
> 
>   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
> specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
> work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
> in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
> to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
> the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
> parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
> patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
> conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
> for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
> contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
> or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 
>   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
> any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
> otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 
>   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 
>   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
> covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
> not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
> to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
> the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
> License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 
>   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
> permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
> under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
> combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
> License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
> but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
> section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
> combination as such.
> 
>   14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
> the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
> Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
> Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
> option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
> version or of any later version published by the Free Software
> Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
> GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
> by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
> versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
> public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
> to choose that version for the Program.
> 
>   Later license versions may give you additional or different
> permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
> author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
> later version.
> 
>   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
> 
>   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
> APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
> HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
> OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
> THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
> PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
> IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
> ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   16. Limitation of Liability.
> 
>   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
> THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
> GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
> USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
> DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
> PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
> EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
> SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
>   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
> 
>   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
> above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
> reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
> an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
> Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
> copy of the Program in return for a fee.

>             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
>   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
>

>                             Preamble
> 
>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
> software and other kinds of works.
> 
>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
> or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
> know their rights.
> 
>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
> 
>   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
> authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
> authors of previous versions.
> 
>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
> protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those

>                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
>   0. Definitions.
> 
>   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 
>   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
> works, such as semiconductor masks.
> 
>   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
> License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
> "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
> 
>   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
> exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
> earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
> 
>   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
> on the Program.
> 
>   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
> permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
> infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
> computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
> distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
> public, and in some countries other activities as well.
> 
>   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
> parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
> a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
> 
>   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
> feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
> tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
> extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
> work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
> the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
> menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
> 
>   1. Source Code.
> 
>   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
> form of a work.
> 
>   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
> standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
> interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
> is widely used among developers working in that language.
> 
>   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
> than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
> packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
> Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
> Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
> implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
> "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
> (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
> control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
> System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
> programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
> which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
> includes interface definition files associated with source files for
> the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
> linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
> such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
> subprograms and other parts of the work.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
> can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
> Source.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
> same work.
> 
>   2. Basic Permissions.
> 
>   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
> copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
> conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
> permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
> covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
> content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
> rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 
>   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
> convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
> in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
> of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
> with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
> the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
> not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
> for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
> and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
> your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 
>   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
> the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
> makes it unnecessary.
> 
>   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
> 
>   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
> measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
> 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
> similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
> measures.
> 
>   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
> circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
> is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
> the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
> modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
> users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
> technological measures.
> 
>   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 
>   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
> receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
> keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
> non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
> keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
> recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
> and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 
>   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 
>   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
>     it, and giving a relevant date.
> 
>     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
>     released under this License and any conditions added under section
>     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
> 
>     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
>     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
>     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
>     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
>     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
>     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
>     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> 
>     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
>     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
>     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
>     work need not make them do so.
> 
>   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
> works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
> and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
> in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
> "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
> used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
> beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
> parts of the aggregate.
> 
>   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
> of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
> machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
> in one of these ways:
> 
>     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
>     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
>     customarily used for software interchange.
> 
>     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
>     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
>     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
>     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
>     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
>     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
>     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
>     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
>     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
>     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> 
>     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
>     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
>     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
>     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
>     with subsection 6b.
> 
>     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
>     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
>     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
>     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
>     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
>     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
>     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
>     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> 
>     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
>     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
>     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
>     charge under subsection 6d.
> 
>   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
> from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
> included in conveying the object code work.
> 
>   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
> into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
> doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
> product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
> typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
> of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
> actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
> is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
> commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
> the only significant mode of use of the product.
> 
>   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
> procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
> and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
> a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
> suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
> code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
> modification has been made.
> 
>   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
> specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
> part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
> User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
> fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
> Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
> by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
> if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
> modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
> been installed in ROM).
> 
>   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
> requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
> for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
> the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
> network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
> adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
> protocols for communication across the network.
> 
>   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
> in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
> documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
> source code form), and must require no special password or key for
> unpacking, reading or copying.
> 
>   7. Additional Terms.
> 
>   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
> License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
> Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
> be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
> that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
> apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
> under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
> this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> 
>   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
> remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
> it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
> removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
> additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
> for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 
>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> 
>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> 
>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> 
>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
>     authors of the material; or
> 
>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> 
>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
>     those licensors and authors.
> 
>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
> restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
> received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
> governed by this License along with a term that is a further
> restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
> a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
> License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
> of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
> not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 
>   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
> must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
> additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
> where to find the applicable terms.
> 
>   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
> form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
> the above requirements apply either way.
> 
>   8. Termination.
> 
>   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
> provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
> modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
> this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
> paragraph of section 11).
> 
>   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
> license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
> finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
> holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
> prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 
>   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
>   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
> material under section 10.
> 
>   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 
>   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
> run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
> to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
> nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
> modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
> not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
> covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 
>   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 
>   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
> receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
> propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 
>   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
> organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
> organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
> work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
> transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
> licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
> give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
> Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
> the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> 
>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
> rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
> not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
> rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
> any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
> sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 
>   11. Patents.
> 
>   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
> License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
> work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> 
>   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
> owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
> hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
> by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
> but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
> consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
> purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
> patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
> this License.
> 
>   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
> make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
> propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 
>   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
> sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
> party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
> patent against the party.
> 
>   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
> and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
> to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
> publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
> then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
> available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
> patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
> consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
> license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
> actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
> covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
> country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 
>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
> work and works based on it.
> 
>   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
> specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
> work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
> in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
> to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
> the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
> parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
> patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
> conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
> for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
> contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
> or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 
>   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
> any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
> otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 
>   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 
>   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
> covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
> not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
> to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
> the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
> License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 
>   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
> permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
> under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
> combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
> License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
> but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
> section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
> combination as such.
> 
>   14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
> the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
> Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
> Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
> option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
> version or of any later version published by the Free Software
> Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
> GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
> by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
> versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
> public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
> to choose that version for the Program.
> 
>   Later license versions may give you additional or different
> permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
> author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
> later version.
> 
>   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
> 
>   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

> 
>   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
> General Public License.
> 
>   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
> other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
> 
>   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
> by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
> Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
> of using an interface provided by the Library.
> 
>   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
> Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
> with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
> Version".
> 
>   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
> Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
> for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
> based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
> object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data

> Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
> 
>   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
>

> 
>   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a

> 
>    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of

> 
>   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
> 
>   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
> a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
> code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
> material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
> layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
> (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
> 
>    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
>    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
>    covered by this License.
> 
>    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
>    document.
> 
>   4. Combined Works.
> 
>   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
> taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
> portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
> engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of

> 
>    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
>    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
>    covered by this License.
> 
>    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
>    document.
> 
>    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
>    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
>    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
>    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
> 
>    d) Do one of the following:
> 
>        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
>        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
>        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
>        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
>        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
>        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
>        Corresponding Source.
> 
>        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
>        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
>        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
>        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
>        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
>        Version.
> 
>    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
>    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
>    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
>    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
>    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
>    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
>    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
>    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
>    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
>    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
>    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
> 
>   5. Combined Libraries.
> 
>   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
> Library side by side in a single library together with other library
> facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
> License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
> choice, if you do both of the following:
> 
>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
>    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
>    conveyed under the terms of this License.
> 
>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
>    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
>    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
> 
>   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
> of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
> Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
> of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that published version or of any later version
> published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
> received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
> whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
> apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
> permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
> Library.

> offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed
> Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially
> modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if

> 9. CONFIDENTIALITY
> 
> Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may
> receive information about the other Party's business, business methods,
> business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other
> information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and
> of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be
> significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties ("Confidential
> Information"). Accordingly, when a Party (the "Receiving Party") receives
> Confidential Information from the other Party (the "Disclosing Party"), the
> Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and
> Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and
> employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential
> Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a
> third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii)
> not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose
> other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities
> pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to
> protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall
> not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own
> confidential and proprietary information.
> 
> Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or
> becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the
> Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to

> use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the
> Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not
> had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven
> by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to
> the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an
> obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled
> to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing
> Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential
> nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to
> limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential
> Information to the minimum extent necessary.
> 
> The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a
> period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade
> secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade
> secret laws.
> 
> 10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT

> integrating (all jointly "installing") the Redistributables with the Devices or
> for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this
> Agreement.
> 
> Each time Licensee "installs" or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then
> one Distribution License is used, and Licensee's account of available
> Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.
> 
> Licensee may "install" copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has
> Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.
> 
> Redistributables will be deemed to have been "installed" into a Device when one
> of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables
> have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee's premises or
> b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory
> (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use
> (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device,
> e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after
> delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee

> 10.5 Taxes
> 
> All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but
> exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or

> conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee's
> place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular
> business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere
> with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor
> acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee's

> Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.
> 
> In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms

> 
> 3. Distribution Obligations.
> 
>      3.1. Application of License.
>      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
>      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
>      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
>      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
>      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
>      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
>      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
>      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
>      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
>      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
>      Section 3.5.
> 
>      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
>      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
>      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
>      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
>      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
>      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
>      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
>      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
>      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
>      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
>      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
>      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
> 
>      3.3. Description of Modifications.
>      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
>      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
>      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
>      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
>      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
>      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
>      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
>      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
> 
>      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
>           (a) Third Party Claims.
>           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
>           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
>           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
>           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
>           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
>           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
>           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
>           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
>           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
>           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
>           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
>           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
>           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
> 
>           (b) Contributor APIs.
>           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
>           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
>           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
>           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
> 
>                (c)    Representations.
>           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
>           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
>           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
>           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
>           this License.
> 
>      3.5. Required Notices.
>      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
>      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
>      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
>      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
>      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
>      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
>      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
>      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
>      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
>      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
>      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
>      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
>      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
>      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
>      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
>      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
>      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
>      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
>      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
>      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
>      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
>      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
>      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
>      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
>      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
>      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
>      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
>      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
>      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
>      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
>      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
>      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
>      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
>      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
>      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
>      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
>      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
>      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
>      terms You offer.
> 
>      3.7. Larger Works.
>      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
>      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
>      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
>      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
> 
>      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
>      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
>      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
>      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
>      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
>      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
>      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
>      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
>      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
>      understand it.
> 
> 5. Application of this License.
> 
>      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
>      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
> 
> 6. Versions of the License.
> 
>      6.1. New Versions.
>      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
>      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
>      will be given a distinguishing version number.
> 
>      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
>      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
>      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
>      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
>      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
>      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
>      Covered Code created under this License.
> 
>      6.3. Derivative Works.
>      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
>      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
>      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
>      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
>      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
>      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
>      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
>      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
>      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
>      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
>      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
>      this License.)
> 
> 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
>      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
>      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
>      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
>      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
>      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
>      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
>      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
>      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 8. TERMINATION.
> 
>      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
>      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
>      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
>      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
>      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
>      shall survive.
> 
>      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
>      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
>      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
>      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
> 
>      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
>      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
>      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
>      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
>      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
>      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
>      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
>      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
>      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
>      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
>      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
>      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
>      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
>      the 60 day notice period specified above.
> 
>      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
>      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
>      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
>      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
>      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
>      Participant.
> 
>      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
>      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
>      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>      license.
> 
>      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
>      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
>      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
>      prior to termination shall survive termination.
> 
> 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL

License of `libjpeg-turbo`:

> libjpeg-turbo Licenses
> ======================
> 
> libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
> 
> - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
>   [README.ijg](README.ijg)
> 
>   This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
>   (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
> 
> - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below
> 
>   This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
>   well as the build system.
> 
> - The [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)
> 
>   This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
>   SIMD extensions.
> 
> 
> Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
> =========================================
> 
> This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
> best of our understanding.
> 
> 1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
>     then:
> 
>     1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
>         from the source.
> 
>         **Origin**
>         - Clause 1 of the IJG License
>         - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
>         - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
> 
>     2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
>         file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
>         there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
>         simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
> 
>         **Origin**
>         - Clause 1 of the IJG License
>         - Clause 2 of the zlib License
> 
>     3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
>         copyright or license text in that file.
> 
>         **Origin**
>         - Clause 1 of the IJG License
> 
> 2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
>     if you are distributing an application that statically links with
>     libjpeg-turbo, then:
> 
>     1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:
> 
>         This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
>         Group.
> 
>         **Origin**
>         - Clause 2 of the IJG license
> 
>     2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
>         your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
>         License (see below.)
> 
>         **Origin**
>         - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
> 
> 3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
>     contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
> 
>     **Origin**
>     - IJG License
>     - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
> 
> 4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
>     free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
>     consequences resulting from your use of the software.
> 
>     **Origin**
>     - IJG License
>     - Modified BSD License
>     - zlib License
> 
> 
> The Modified (3-clause) BSD License

> Why Three Licenses?
> ===================
> 
> The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
> License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
> conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
> libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
> License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
> attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
> desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
> that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
