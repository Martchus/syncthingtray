Please read the following points before filing an issue but remove them before
filing the issue:

* **Please browse through the [README](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/README.md) before asking a question.**
  Maybe what you've been asking is already implemented
  or a known limitation with a documented workaround.
* Note that I cannot support all operating systems, their flavors and different
  tooling you might be using (Antivirus software, GNU/Linux desktop environments,
  AUR helpers, …). So please avoid filing feature requests specific to them and
  contact the respective vendors instead.
* Note that I will likely have to reject feature reports about Wayland-specific
  behavior due to limitations of that protocol which I cannot workaround from my
  side.
