**Please browse through the [README](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/README.md) before asking a question.**
Most likely your question is already answered.
Before asking questions about the AUR package, please read the [pinned comment
on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syncthingtray#comment-568348).

Note that I cannot give concrete help for all operating systems, their flavors
and different tooling you might be using (Anti Virus scanners, GNU/Linux desktop
environments, AUR helpers, …). So if you want concrete advice about those you
must ask the respective vendors instead.
