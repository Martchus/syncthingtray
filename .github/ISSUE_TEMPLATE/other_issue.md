Please read the following points before filing an issue but remove them before
filing the issue:

* **Do not file an issue if the executable is framed as malicious by Antivirus
  software.** If you have actual evidence that the executable is doing anything
  malicious you can of course file a report. Note that the executable being
  detected by Antivirus software is not good enough evidence as false positives
  are very common and no concrete description of the problem is provided.
* **Please browse through the [README](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/README.md) before asking a question.**
  Most likely your question is already answered.
  Before asking questions about the AUR package, please read the [pinned comment
  on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syncthingtray#comment-568348).
* Note that I cannot give concrete help for all operating systems, their flavors
  and different tooling you might be using (Anti Virus scanners, GNU/Linux desktop
  environments, AUR helpers, …). So if you want concrete advice about those you
  must ask the respective vendors instead.
