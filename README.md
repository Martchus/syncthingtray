  which is not enabled by default)
* English and German localization

## Does this launch or bundle Syncthing itself? What about my existing Syncthing installation?
Syncthing Tray does *not* launch Syncthing itself by default. There should be no interference with your existing
Syncthing installation. You might consider different configurations:

* If you're happy how Syncthing is started on your system so far just tell Syncthing Tray to connect to your currently
  running Syncthing instance in the settings. If you're currently starting Syncthing via systemd you might consider
  enabling the systemd integration in the settings (see section *Configuring systemd integration*).
* If you would like Syncthing Tray to take care of starting Syncthing for you, you can use the Syncthing launcher
  available in the settings.
    * The Windows builds provided in the release section on GitHub come with a built-in version of Syncthing
      which you can consider to use. Keep in mind that automatic updates of Syncthing are not possible this way.
    * In any case you can simply point the launcher to the binary of Syncthing (which you have to download/install
      separately).
    * Checkout the *Configuring the built-in launcher* section for further details.
* It is also possible to let Syncthing Tray connect to a Syncthing instance running on a different machine.

## Configuring systemd integration
The next section explains what it is good for and how to use it. If it doesn't work on your
system please read the subsequent sections as well before filing an issue.

### Using the systemd integration
With the system configured correctly and systemd support enabled at build-time the following
features are available:

* Starting and stopping the systemd unit of Syncthing
* Consider the unit status when connecting to the local instance to prevent connection attempts
  when Syncthing isn't running anyways
* Detect when the system has just been resumed from standby to avoid the "Disconnect"
  notification in that case

However, these features are optional. To use them they must be enabled in the settings dialog
first.

It is recommended to enable "Consider unit status …". Note that Syncthing might still not be immediately
ready to serve API requests when the systemd unit turns active. Hence it is still required to configure
a re-connect interval. The re-connect interval will only be in effect while the systemd unit is active.
So despite the re-connect interval there will be no connection attempts while the systemd unit is
inactive. That's all the systemd integration can optimize in that regard.

Be aware that Syncthing Tray assumes by default that the systemd unit is a
[user unit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User). If you are using
a regular system-wide unit (including those started with `…@username`) you need to enable the
"System unit" checkbox in the settings. Note that starting and stopping the system-wide Syncthing
unit requires authorization (systemd can ask through PolicyKit).

### Required system configuration
The communication between Syncthing Tray and systemd is implemented using systemd's D-Bus service.
That means systemd's D-Bus service (which is called `org.freedesktop.systemd1`) must be running on
your D-Bus. For [user units](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User) the session D-Bus is
relevant and for regular units (including those started with `…@username`) the system D-Bus is relevant.

It seems that systemd's D-Bus service is only available when D-Bus itself is started via systemd. That
is by default the case under Arch Linux and openSUSE and likely most other modern distributions where
it is usually started via "socket activation" (e.g. `/usr/lib/systemd/user/dbus.socket` for the session
D-Bus).

All of this counts for the session D-Bus *and* for the system D-Bus although the startup of the session
D-Bus can be screwed up particularly easy. One easy way to screw it up is to start a second instance of
the session D-Bus manually e.g. via `dbus-run-session`. When starting the session D-Bus this way the
systemd integration will *not* work and you will likely end up with two session D-Bus processes. It is
also worth noticing that you do *not* need to set the `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` variable manually
because the systemd file `dbus.socket` should take care of this.

Note that the Plasma Wayland session screwed things up in the way I've described. This has been fixed with
[Only spawn dbus-run-session if there isn't a session already](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/128)
but this change might not be available on older distributions.

### Build-time configuration
The systemd integration can be explicitly enabled/disabled add compile time by adding
`-DSYSTEMD_SUPPORT=ON/OFF` to the CMake arguments. If the systemd integration does not work be sure your
version of Syncthing Tray has been compiled with systemd support.

Note for distributors: There will be no hard dependency to systemd in any case. Distributions supporting
alternative init systems do *not* need to provide differently configured versions of Syncthing Tray.
Disabling the systemd integration is mainly intended for systems which do not use systemd at all (e.g.
Windows and MacOS).

## Configuring the built-in launcher
The built-in launcher can be accessed and configured within the settings dialog. The GUI should be
self-explaining.

It is recommended to enable "Consider process status …". Note that Syncthing might not be immediately
ready to serve API requests when started. Hence it is still required to configure a re-connect interval.
The re-connect interval will only be in effect while the Syncthing process is running. So despite the
re-connect interval there will be no connection attempts while the Syncthing process is not running.

## Hotkeys
Use the same approach as for launching an arbitrary application via a hotkey. Make it invoke

* `syncthingtray --trigger` to show the tray menu.
* `syncthingtray --webui` to show the web UI.
* `syncthingctl [...]` to trigger a particular action. See `syncthingctl -h` for details.

## Build instructions
The application depends on [c++utilities](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities),
[qtutilities](https://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities) and
[qtforkawesome](https://github.com/Martchus/qtforkawesome) and is built the same way as these libraries.
For basic instructions checkout the README file of [c++utilities](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities).
For building this straight, see the section below. There's also documentation about
[various build variables](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities/blob/master/doc/buildvariables.md) which
can be passed to CMake to influence the build.

### Further dependencies
The following Qt modules are required (version 5.6 or newer): `core`, `network`, `dbus`, `gui`, `widgets`,
`svg`, `webenginewidgets`/`webkitwidgets`

It is recommended to use at least Qt 5.14 to avoid limitations in previous versions (see *Known bugs* section).

The built-in web view and therefore the modules webenginewidgets/webkitwidgets are optional (see
section *Select Qt module for WebView*).

To build the plugin for Dolphin integration KIO is also required. Additionally, the Dolphin plugin requires
Qt 5.8 or newer. To skip building the plugin, add `-DNO_FILE_ITEM_ACTION_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON` to the CMake arguments.

To build the Plasmoid for the Plasma 5 desktop, the Qt module QML and the KF5 module Plasma are required as
well. Additionally, the Plasmoid requires Qt 5.12 or newer. To skip building the Plasmoid, add
`-DNO_PLASMOID:BOOL=ON` to the CMake arguments.

---

The following Boost libraries are required: `Boost.Asio`, `Boost.Process`, `Boost.Filesystem`

The launcher uses these libraries by default to handle sub processes correctly (and avoid leftover processes).
Add `-DUSE_BOOST_PROCESS:BOOL:OFF` to the CMake arguments to get rid of the dependency to Boost libraries.
This disables handling sub processes and `QProcess` (from Qt Core) is used instead.

---

It is also possible to build only the CLI (`syncthingctl`) by adding `-DNO_MODEL:BOOL=ON` and
`-DNO_FILE_ITEM_ACTION_PLUGIN:BOOL=ON` to the CMake arguments. Then only the Qt modules `core`,
`network` and `dbus` are required.

---

To get rid of systemd support, add `-DENABLE_SYSTEMD_SUPPORT_BY_DEFAULT` to the CMake arguments.
In this case the Qt module `dbus` is not required anymore. Note that there is no hard dependency
to systemd in any case.

---

Building the testsuite requires CppUnit and Qt 5.8 or higher.

### Building this straight
0. Install (preferably the latest version of) the CGG toolchain or Clang, the required Qt modules and CMake.
1. Get the sources. For the latest version from Git clone the following repositories:
   ```
   cd $SOURCES
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities.git c++utilities
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities.git
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/Martchus/qtforkawesome.git
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome.git forkawesome
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray.git
   git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/Martchus/subdirs.git
   ```
   Note that `-c core.symlinks=true` is only required under Windows to handle symlinks correctly.
   This requires a recent Git version and a filesystem which supports symlinks (NTFS works).
   If you run into "not found" errors on symlink creation use `git reset --hard` within the repository to
   fix this.
2. Configure the build
   ```
   cd $BUILD_DIR
   cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/install/prefix" \
    -DFORK_AWESOME_FONT_FILE="$SOURCES/forkawesome/fonts/forkawesome-webfont.woff2" \
    -DFORK_AWESOME_ICON_DEFINITIONS="$SOURCES/forkawesome/src/icons/icons.yml" \
    $SOURCES/subdirs/syncthingtray
   ```
    * Replace `/install/prefix` with the directory where you want to install.
    * Checkout the [Providing the font file](https://github.com/Martchus/qtforkawesome/#providing-the-font-file)
      section of qtforkawesome's README for details regarding the
      ForkAwesome-related parameters.
3. Build and install everything in one step:
   ```
   cd $BUILD_DIR
   make install -j$(nproc)
   ```
    * If the install directory is not writable, do **not** conduct the build as root. Instead, set `DESTDIR` to a
      writable location (e.g. `make DESTDIR="temporary/install/dir" install …`) and move the files from there to
      the desired location afterwards.

### Select Qt module for web view and JavaScript
* Add `-DWEBVIEW_PROVIDER:STRING=webkit/webengine/none` to the CMake arguments to use either Qt WebKit (works with
  'revived' version as well), Qt WebEngine or no web view at all. If no web view is used, the Syncthing web UI is
  opened in the default web browser. Otherwise the user can choose between the built-in web view and the web browser.
* Add `-DJS_PROVIDER:STRING=script/qml/none` to the CMake arguments to use either Qt Script, Qt QML or no JavaScript
  engine at all. If no JavaScript engine is used, the CLI does not support scripting configuration changes.

#### Limitations of Qt WebEngine compared to Qt WebKit
* When using a version of Qt older than 5.14 there is no way to allow only a particular self-signed certificate in Qt
  WebEngine. That means any self-signed certificate is accepted! See: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-51176
* Qt WebEngine can not be built with GCC/mingw-w64 for Windows.
* Security issues are not a concern because no other website than the Syncthing web UI is shown. Any external links
  will be opened in the regular web browser anyways.

### Troubleshooting KDE integration
If the Dolphin integration or the Plasmoid don't work, check whether the files for those components
have been installed in the right directories.

For instance, under Tumbleweed it looks like this for the Plasmoid:
```
/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins/plasma/applets/libsyncthingplasmoid.so
/usr/share/kservices5/plasma-applet-martchus.syncthingplasmoid.desktop
/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/martchus.syncthingplasmoid/contents/ui/*.qml
/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/martchus.syncthingplasmoid/metadata.desktop
/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/martchus.syncthingplasmoid/metadata.json

```

The files for the Dolphin integration look like this under Tumbleweed:
```
/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins/libsyncthingfileitemaction.so
/usr/share/kservices5/syncthingfileitemaction.desktop
```

The directory the `*.so` file needs to be installed to seems to differ from distribution to
distribution. The right directory for your distribution can be queried from qmake using
`qmake-qt5 -query QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS`. In doubt, just look where other Qt plugins are stored.

Actually the build system should be able to do that query automatically. It is also possible to
specify the directory manually, e.g. for Tumbleweed one would add
`-DQT_PLUGIN_DIR=/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins` to the CMake arguments.

---

Also be sure that the version of the plasma framework the plasmoid was built against is *not* newer
than the version actually installed on the system. That can for instance easily happen when using
`tumbleweed-cli` for sticking to a previous snapshot but having the latest version of the plasmoid
from my home repository installed.

---

If the Plasmoid still won't load, checkout the log of `plasmashell`/`plasmoidviewer`/`plasmawindowed`.
Also consider using strace to find out at which paths the shell is looking for `*.desktop` and
`*.so` files.

For a development setup of the KDE integration, continue reading the subsequent section.

## Contributing, developing, debugging
### Translations
Currently translations for English and German are available. Qt's built-in localization/translation
framework is used under the hood.

Note that `syncthingctl` has not been internationalized yet so it supports only English.

#### Add a new locale
Translations for further locales can be added quite easily:

1. Append a new translation file for the desired locale to the `TS_FILES` list
   in `connector/CMakeLists.txt`, `model/CMakeLists.txt`, `widgets/CMakeLists.txt`,
   `fileitemactionplugin/CMakeLists.txt`, `plasmoid/CMakeLists.txt` and
   `tray/CMakeLists.txt`.
2. Configure a new build, e.g. follow steps under *Building this straight*.
3. Conduct a full build or generate only translation files via the `translations` target.
4. New translation files should have been created by the build system under
   `connector/translations`, `model/translations`, `widgets/translations`,
   `fileitemactionplugin/translations`, `plasmoid/translations` and
   `tray/translations` and the `translations` folder of `qtutilities`.
5. Open the files with Qt Linguist to add translations. Qt Linguist is part of
   the [Qt Tools repository](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttools.git/) and its usage
   is [well documented](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html).

#### Extend/update existing translations
* For English, update the corresponding string literals within the source code.
* If necassary, sync the translation files with the source code like in step `2.`/`3.` of
  "Add a new locale". Check that no translations have been lost (except ones which are no
  longer required of course).
* Change the strings within the translation files found within the `translations`
  directories like in step `4.`/`5.` of "Add a new locale".

#### Remarks
* Syncthing Tray displays also text from [qtutilities](https://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities).
  Hence it makes sense adding translations there as well (following the same procedure).
* The CLI `syncthingctl` currently does not support translations.

### Using backend libraries
The contained backend libraries (which provide connecting to Syncthing, data models and more) are written for internal
use within the components contained by this repository.

Hence those libraries do *not* provide a stable ABI/API. If you like to
use them to develop Syncthing integration or tooling with Qt and C++, it makes most sense to contribute it as an additional component
directly to this repository. Then I will be able to take it into account when changing the API.

### KDE integration
Since the Dolphin integration and the Plasmoid are plugins, testing and debugging requires a few extra steps.
See [Testing and debugging Dolphin/KIO plugin with Qt Creator](/fileitemactionplugin/testing.md)
and [Testing and debugging Plasma 5 plasmoid with Qt Creator](/plasmoid/testing.md).

### Logging
It is possible to turn on logging of the underlying library by setting environment variables:

* `LIB_SYNCTHING_CONNECTOR_LOG_ALL`: log everything mentioned in points below
* `LIB_SYNCTHING_CONNECTOR_LOG_API_CALLS`: log calls to Syncthing's REST-API
* `LIB_SYNCTHING_CONNECTOR_LOG_API_REPLIES`: log replies from Syncthing's REST-API (except events)
* `LIB_SYNCTHING_CONNECTOR_LOG_EVENTS`: log events emitted by Syncthing's events REST-API endpoint
* `LIB_SYNCTHING_CONNECTOR_LOG_DIRS_OR_DEVS_RESETTED`: log when directories/devices are internally reset

## Known bugs and workarounds
The following bugs are caused by dependencies or limitations of certain
platforms. For bugs of Syncthing Tray itself, checkout the issues on GitHub.

### Workaround positioning issues under Wayland
The Qt Widgets based version basically works under Wayland but there are
positioning issues and the settings regarding positioning have no effect (see
"List of bugs" section below). One can workaround this limitation by telling the
window manager how to place the window, e.g. under Sway one could add a
configuration like this:

```
for_window [title="^Syncthing Tray( \(.*\))?$"] floating enable, border none, resize set 450 400, move position 916 0
```

### Workaround missing support for Windows 10 dark mode
The dark mode introduced in Windows 10 does not affect traditional desktop
applications like Syncthing Tray. Unfortunately, Windows normal theming capabilities 
[have been removed](https://superuser.com/questions/949920/window-color-and-appearance-removed-in-win10).
So far Qt does not offer much to improve the situation (see "List of bugs" below).

However, it is possible to use Syncthing Tray's custom appearance settings to
achieve a dark theming:

* To enable dark Window borders, set the environment variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORM`
  to `windows:darkmode=1`.
* To enable dark colors for Syncthing Tray's UI elements, configure a dark color
  palette in Syncthing Tray's settings under "Qt/Appearance". You can download and
  load the file as a base
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/master/tray/resources/dark-palette.ini
  and tweak the colors to your liking.
* To make the rest of the colors used by Syncthing Tray fit with the dark color
  palette, enable "Bright custom text colors" in Syncthing Tray's settings under
  "Tray/Appearance".
* To make general icons fit with the dark color palette, configure an
  appropriate icon them, e.g. select "Breeze Dark" as icon theme in Syncthing
  Tray's settings under "Qt/Appearance".
* To make Syncthing icons fit with the dark color palette, configure their
  colors in Syncthing Tray's settings under "Tray/UI icons" and "Tray/System
  icons". The "Use preset" button allows to select pre-defined colors suitable for
  a dark color palette.
* Select the widgets style "Fusion" under "Qt/Appearance". This is required
  because the native styling provided by Windows for traditional desktop
  applications does not look very nice when using a dark color palette.

After changing these settings, restart Syncthing Tray. It is not sufficient to
close the last Windows; the process needs to be restarted.

It is also possible to enable Windows' "High contrast" setting which seems to
bring back the traditional theming/coloring but unfortunately doesn't look very
nice overall. Check https://github.com/tomasz1986/classic2000 to see how Windows
looks like with high contrast applied, or if you're in need for themes that look
at least nicer than what's shipped with Windows.

### Enable experimental support for Windows' per-monitor DPI awareness (V2)
[PMv2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/hidpi/high-dpi-desktop-application-development-on-windows#per-monitor-and-per-monitor-v2-dpi-awareness)
is not working out of the box but experimental support can be enabled in the
Qt 6 build by setting the environment variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` to
`windows:dpiawareness=3`.

### List of bugs
* Wayland limitations
    * The tray menu can not be positioned correctly under Wayland because the protocol does not allow setting window positions from
      the client-side (at least I don't know a way to do it). This issue can not be fixed unless Wayland provides an API to set the
      window position to specific coordinates or a system tray icon.
      See discussion on [freedesktop.org](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2014-August/017584.html).
      Note that the Plasmoid is not affected by this limitation.
    * While the tray menu is shown its entry is shown in the taskbar. Not sure whether there is a way to avoid this.
* Qt bugs
    * Qt < 5.14

    * Qt < 5.9:
        * Pausing/resuming folders and devices doesn't work when using scan-intervals with a lot of zeros because of
          Syncthing bug https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4001. This has already been fixed on the Qt-side with
          https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/187069/. However, the fix is only available in Qt 5.9 and above.
    * any Qt version:
        * The tray disconnects from the local instance when the network connection goes down. The network connection must be restored
          or the tray restarted to be able to connect to local Syncthing again. This is caused by Qt bug
          https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-60949.
        * The dark mode introduced in Windows 10 is not supported, see https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-72028.
* KDE limitations
    * High-DPI scaling of Plasmoid is broken under X11 (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356446).
    * The Plasmoid contents are possibly clipped when shown within the system notifications plasmoid.
* Systemd integration
    * This feature relies especially on the system being correctly configured. Checkout the *Required system configuration* section
      for details.
