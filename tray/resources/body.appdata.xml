    Syncthing Tray complements the normal web-based UI of Syncthing itself providing the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tray icon showing the overall status of Syncthing</li>
    <li>A tray menu showing more detailed status information that also allows to quickly perform common actions such as triggering a rescan</li>
    <li>Notifications for certain events</li>
    <li>Quick access to the normal web-based UI of Syncthing</li>
    <li>Integration with systemd and launcher for Syncthing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that this is the desktop environment independent version. The Plasmoid/KDE-integrations might be installed via a different
    distribution-specific package (but cannot be provided as Flatpak for technical reasons).
